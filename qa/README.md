# Flexatorium Testing

This directory contains end-to-end testing for the project.

# Setup and Run

Use the requirements.txt file in this directory to build a virtual environment. 
Name the virtual environment qa_env to keep it out of github.
Testing will use a different virtual environment than running the application.
